## Exercises

#### Give a light to light switch
Edit your previous [light switch](https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/javascript-class2#light-switch-program) exercise.

- Add button that to switch the light on and off.
- The colour of the body changes (toggles) when the switch is clicked to dark when the light is _off_ and bright when is _on_.
- By default the light is off.
 

**TBD**: add hint what selectors to use and how to change the element.
