# Javascript II
From previous session you should know what is:

- value
- variable
- expression

Today, we learn about:

- conditions - *if statements*
- functions
- loops
- object

## Exercises
To work on these exercises you need to clone, or pull the repository. Each exercise has a file, where you write solution, e.g. _file: `light_switch.js`_

All the files are required in `index.html` file, but they are commented out. When you start working on the exercise, uncomment the file for the exercise, open `index.html` in the browser. Then, you can do a change to the file you are working on, refresh browser and see latest changes.

When you move to next exercise, again comment out the one you worked before and uncomment the next you are going to work on.

**Tip**

You can print to console with old known `console.log("message");`, or you can write also to HTML document directly with `document.write('message' + '<br />')`.

### Conditions

#### Light switch program
file: `light_switch.js`

- Use a boolean variable to store information that the room is dark, or not.
- Write a condition which tells to switch the light on if the room is dark. You can print it to console using `console.log('Turn the light on')`

#### Buying a pizza program
file: `buy_pizza.js`
Check whether you have enough money to buy a pizza.

- Store into variables: how much money you have, what is the cost of the pizza.
- Write a condition to find out whether you have enough money to buy a pizza. If user does not have enough money, tell them how much more do they need to buy a pizza.

#### Do not forget your size for shirts again
This program helps with choosing a shirt size based on the size of chest.

- Store information about the sizes: S, M, L, XL.

| name   | size (cm) |
---------|------------
| S      | 91        |
| M      | 96        |
| L      | 101       |
| XL     | 106       |


- Store a size in (cm)
- Write program that calculate a name of the size.
- Hint: size S is between 91 and 96, but does not include 96.

### Loop

#### Flip coin
file: `flip_coin.js`

Keep flipping a coin until you get head.

Face of the coin is represented with number 1 for head and 0 for face. The **coin is flipped** by "randomly"  generating value 1 or 2. JavaScript build-in function can do this `Math.floor(Math.random() * 2)`. We will learn about functions soon, you don't have to understand what it means yet.

- Flip a coin and assign it to a variable
- Use a loop to test whether the flip is face of tail. If it is a tail, print the message telling user had no luck and flip coin again.
- The program is expected to finish when the user got head (flip function generated number 1). Print to the console message telling user that got head.

#### Food server
file: `food_server.js`

Don't let customers hungry.

- store number of customers
- use a loop to server food as many times as there is number of customers. Each time print to console message that you are serving and number of the customer.

### Functions

#### Coin flipper with function
file: `flip_coin.js`

In coin flipper program, we flip the coin on two places. We use for this expression `Math.floor(Math.random() * 2)` and it is not very clear to understand what it means at the first look. We can do better.

- Change your program to use function instead of `Math.floor(Math.random() * 2)` to flip the coin.

Look on the code, can you change it to flip the coin only once?

#### Sum it!
file: `adder.js`

Write a program accepts 2 numbers and returns their sum.

#### Magic Vendor machine - (optionally for homework)
file: `vendor_machine.js`

Make the simplest vendor machine in the world. It has only 3 things: cheesecake, pizza, coke. The best thing about this machine is that its for free! It has a catch. You need to tell it a secret phrase, which is "supermachineopen".

In this exercise we use something new, **switch** statement. You can learn about switch in [w3 tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_switch.asp)

**Few tips on how to do it**

- Store secret phase to a variable.
- Ask user the secret phrase (use `prompt("message");` build-in function) and store it to variable.
- Write a function called e.g. vendorMachineServe which accepts a secret phrase user entered as an argument.

Instructions for the body of vendorMachineServe function:

- Compare the passphrase entered by the user with the correct one.
- If the passphrase is correct:
  - write and use another function to print the options for user to choose from options. Just like in real vendor machines code number is used to identify option: 1 - cheesecake; 2 - pizza; 3 - coke
  - ask user to make a choice (use `prompt("message");` build-in function) and he or she enters a number representing the choice (1 - 3)
  - print to console message saying you are serving the food and repeat the name of the item e.g. _cheesecake_
  - print to console goodbye message
- If the passphrase is not correct
  - print to console message something like `console.log("Oh no, you don't know the secret.");`  

## Assignment
### Lets build a game - *Rock, Scissors, Paper*
file: `rock_scissor_paper_assignment.js`

#### Rules
User plays against computer. User and computer choose either rock, scissors, or paper. According to following rules user or computer wins a point.

- paper _beats_ rock
- rock _beats_ scissors
- scissors _beats_ paper

If both users have the same choice, the result is _tie_.

#### Instructions
Instructions should help with creating program. You do not have to follow them, because there are many ways to implement the game.

- Prompt user to make a choice and store it to the variable. You can use build-in `prompt("message");` function to do this.
- Computer makes a choice
  - Use `Math.random()` to "randomly" generate integer value between 0 and 1
  - We need to map this random number into a random choice. Lets see how it can be done in the table:

  | number (between) | choice  |
  -------------------|----------
  | 0 - 0.33         | rock    |
  | 0.34 - 0.66      | scissors|
  | 0.67 - 1         | paper   |
  
- Write a function that will compare user's choice with computer choice and say who is the winner.

#### Make it more interesting (optional)
Now, the player needs to win once to be the winner. It would be more interesting if there are 3 rounds and the player who wins at least 2 rounds is the winner.

**Hints**

- Use loop to repeat the rounds.
- Store users score and increment winner's score each round.

## Remember Good Practices and Conventions
- **Variables are like camels** - In JavaScript, variables having multiple words such as _"favourite meal"_, follow a convention: the first word starts with lowercase latter and every other word with capital latter and no spaces or hyphens between words, e.g. _favouriteMeal_. Looks like a camel, right? :)

- **Be easy to understand** - programs are read and changed by many people, therefore it is important that they are easy to understand. Variable names play important role.
 
  _For example: variable to get current year:_
  - **bad:** `var y = myFunction();` - you can not guess what `y` mean without looking on place where it was defined.
  - **better:** `var year = myFunction();` - its better because its obvious what `year` means, but can be more specific.
  - **best:** `var currentYear = myFunction();` - no matter where you use `currentYear` you know what it stands for.
